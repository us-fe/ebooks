You may think you know how to write JS, but there&#39;s an awful lot of nuance to various parts of the language grammar that lead to confusion and misconception, so we want to dive into those parts and clear some things up.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> The term &quot;grammar&quot; may be a little less familiar to readers than the term &quot;syntax.&quot; In many ways, they are similar terms, describing the <em>rules</em> for how the language works. There are nuanced differences, but they mostly don&#39;t matter for our discussion here. The grammar for JavaScript is a structured way to describe how the syntax (operators, keywords, etc.) fits together into well-formed, valid programs. In other words, discussing syntax without grammar would leave out a lot of the important details. So our focus here in this chapter is most accurately described as <em>grammar</em>, even though the raw syntax of the language is what developers directly interact with.</p><h2 id="statements-expressions" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#statements-expressions" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Statements &amp; Expressions</h2><p>It&#39;s fairly common for developers to assume that the term &quot;statement&quot; and &quot;expression&quot; are roughly equivalent. But here we need to distinguish between the two, because there are some very important differences in our JS programs.</p><p>To draw the distinction, let&#39;s borrow from terminology you may be more familiar with: the English language.</p><p>A &quot;sentence&quot; is one complete formation of words that expresses a thought. It&#39;s comprised of one or more &quot;phrases,&quot; each of which can be connected with punctuation marks or conjunction words (&quot;and,&quot; &quot;or,&quot; etc). A phrase can itself be made up of smaller phrases. Some phrases are incomplete and don&#39;t accomplish much by themselves, while other phrases can stand on their own. These rules are collectively called the <em>grammar</em> of the English language.</p><p>And so it goes with JavaScript grammar. Statements are sentences, expressions are phrases, and operators are conjunctions/punctuation.</p><p>Every expression in JS can be evaluated down to a single, specific value result. For example:</p><div class="language-javascript ext-js line-numbers-mode"><pre class="language-javascript"><code><span class="token keyword">var</span> a <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token number">3</span> <span class="token operator">*</span> <span class="token number">6</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token keyword">var</span> b <span class="token operator">=</span> a<span class="token punctuation">;</span>
b<span class="token punctuation">;</span>
</code></pre><div class="line-numbers" aria-hidden="true"><span class="line-number">1</span><br><span class="line-number">2</span><br><span class="line-number">3</span><br></div></div><p>In this snippet, <code>3 * 6</code> is an expression (evaluates to the value <code>18</code>). But <code>a</code> on the second line is also an expression, as is <code>b</code> on the third line. The <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> expressions both evaluate to the values stored in those variables at that moment, which also happens to be <code>18</code>.</p><p>Moreover, each of the three lines is a statement containing expressions. <code>var a = 3 * 6</code> and <code>var b = a</code> are called &quot;declaration statements&quot; because they each declare a variable (and optionally assign a value to it). The <code>a = 3 * 6</code> and <code>b = a</code> assignments (minus the <code>var</code>s) are called assignment expressions.</p><p>The third line contains just the expression <code>b</code>, but it&#39;s also a statement all by itself (though not a terribly interesting one!). This is generally referred to as an &quot;expression statement.&quot;</p><h3 id="statement-completion-values" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#statement-completion-values" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Statement Completion Values</h3><p>It&#39;s a fairly little known fact that statements all have completion values (even if that value is just <code>undefined</code>).</p><p>How would you even go about seeing the completion value of a statement?</p><p>The most obvious answer is to type the statement into your browser&#39;s developer console, because when you execute it, the console by default reports the completion value of the most recent statement it executed.</p><p>Let&#39;s consider <code>var b = a</code>. What&#39;s the completion value of that statement?</p><p>The <code>b = a</code> assignment expression results in the value that was assigned (<code>18</code> above), but the <code>var</code> statement itself results in <code>undefined</code>. Why? Because <code>var</code> statements are defined that way in the spec. If you put <code>var a = 42;</code> into your console, you&#39;ll see <code>undefined</code> reported back instead of <code>42</code>.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Technically, it&#39;s a little more complex than that. In the ES5 spec, section 12.2 &quot;Variable Statement,&quot; the <code>VariableDeclaration</code> algorithm actually <em>does</em> return a value (a <code>string</code> containing the name of the variable declared -- weird, huh!?), but that value is basically swallowed up (except for use by the <code>for..in</code> loop) by the <code>VariableStatement</code> algorithm, which forces an empty (aka <code>undefined</code>) completion value.</p><p>In fact, if you&#39;ve done much code experimenting in your console (or in a JavaScript environment REPL -- read/evaluate/print/loop tool), you&#39;ve probably seen <code>undefined</code> reported after many different statements, and perhaps never realized why or what that was. Put simply, the console is just reporting the statement&#39;s completion value.</p><p>But what the console prints out for the completion value isn&#39;t something we can use inside our program. So how can we capture the completion value?</p><p>That&#39;s a much more complicated task. Before we explain <em>how</em>, let&#39;s explore <em>why</em> you would want to do that.</p><p>We need to consider other types of statement completion values. For example, any regular <code>{ .. }</code> block has a completion value of the completion value of its last contained statement/expression.</p><p>Consider:</p><div class="language-javascript ext-js line-numbers-mode"><pre class="language-javascript"><code><span class="token keyword">var</span> b<span class="token punctuation">;</span>

If you try it, you&#39;ll get a <code>ReferenceError</code> error, but why? Because side-effecting operators <strong>require a variable reference</strong> to target their side effects to. For <code>++a++</code>, the <code>a++</code> part is evaluated first (because of operator precedence -- see below), which gives back the value of <code>a</code> <em>before</em> the increment. But then it tries to evaluate <code>++42</code>, which (if you try it) gives the same <code>ReferenceError</code> error, since <code>++</code> can&#39;t have a side effect directly on a value like <code>42</code>.</p><p>It is sometimes mistakenly thought that you can encapsulate the <em>after</em> side effect of <code>a++</code> by wrapping it in a <code>( )</code> pair, like:</p><div class="language-javascript ext-js line-numbers-mode"><pre class="language-javascript"><code><span class="token keyword">var</span> a <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token number">42</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>

In fact, even if it did, <code>a++</code> returns <code>42</code> first, and unless you have another expression that reevaluates <code>a</code> after the side effect of <code>++</code>, you&#39;re not going to get <code>43</code> from that expression, so <code>b</code> will not be assigned <code>43</code>.</p><p>There&#39;s an option, though: the <code>,</code> statement-series comma operator. This operator allows you to string together multiple standalone expression statements into a single statement:</p><div class="language-javascript ext-js line-numbers-mode"><pre class="language-javascript"><code><span class="token keyword">var</span> a <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token number">42</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> b<span class="token punctuation">;</span>

The reason is operator precedence, which we&#39;ll cover later in this chapter.</p><p>The expression <code>a++, a</code> means that the second <code>a</code> statement expression gets evaluated <em>after</em> the <em>after side effects</em> of the first <code>a++</code> statement expression, which means it returns the <code>43</code> value for assignment to <code>b</code>.</p><p>Another example of a side-effecting operator is <code>delete</code>. As we showed in Chapter 2, <code>delete</code> is used to remove a property from an <code>object</code> or a slot from an <code>array</code>.

While this looks like the same thing, it&#39;s not. If that statement were to happen without there also being a separate <code>var b</code> (somewhere in the scope) to formally declare <code>b</code>, then <code>var a = b = 42</code> would not declare <code>b</code> directly.

It&#39;s best to avoid them if possible; for example using function calls instead of the loop jumps. But there are perhaps some limited cases where they might be useful. If you&#39;re going to use a labeled jump, make sure to document what you&#39;re doing with plenty of comments!</p><p>It&#39;s a very common belief that JSON is a proper subset of JS, so a string of JSON (like <code>{&quot;a&quot;:42}</code> -- notice the quotes around the property name as JSON requires!) is thought to be a valid JavaScript program. <strong>Not true!</strong> Try putting <code>{&quot;a&quot;:42}</code> into your JS console, and you&#39;ll get an error.</p><p>That&#39;s because statement labels cannot have quotes around them, so <code>&quot;a&quot;</code> is not a valid label, and thus <code>:</code> can&#39;t come right after it.</p><p>So, JSON is truly a subset of JS syntax, but JSON is not valid JS grammar by itself.</p><p>One extremely common misconception along these lines is that if you were to load a JS file into a <code>&lt;script src=..&gt;</code> tag that only has JSON content in it (like from an API call), the data would be read as valid JavaScript but just be inaccessible to the program. JSON-P (the practice of wrapping the JSON data in a function call, like <code>foo({&quot;a&quot;:42})</code>) is usually said to solve this inaccessibility by sending the value to one of your program&#39;s functions.</p><p><strong>Not true!</strong> The totally valid JSON value <code>{&quot;a&quot;:42}</code> by itself would actually throw a JS error because it&#39;d be interpreted as a statement block with an invalid label. But <code>foo({&quot;a&quot;:42})</code> is valid JS because in it, <code>{&quot;a&quot;:42}</code> is an <code>object</code> literal value being passed to <code>foo(..)</code>.

Because (as we explained earlier) <code>a++</code> has <em>after side effects</em>, the assigned value to <code>b</code> is the value <code>42</code> before the <code>++</code> changes <code>a</code>.</p><p>This is just a simple matter of needing to understand operator precedence. If you&#39;re going to use <code>,</code> as a statement-series operator, it&#39;s important to know that it actually has the lowest precedence.

But this would be an error, because the result of <code>(str &amp;&amp; matches)</code> isn&#39;t going to be a variable, but instead a value (in this case <code>undefined</code>), and so it can&#39;t be the left-hand side of an <code>=</code> assignment!</p><p>OK, so you probably think you&#39;ve got this operator precedence thing down.</p><p>Let&#39;s move on to a more complex example (which we&#39;ll carry throughout the next several sections of this chapter) to <em>really</em> test your understanding:</p><div class="language-javascript ext-js line-numbers-mode"><pre class="language-javascript"><code><span class="token keyword">var</span> a <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token number">42</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>

Let&#39;s revisit that in more detail now.</p><p>For both <code>&amp;&amp;</code> and <code>||</code> operators, the right-hand operand will <strong>not be evaluated</strong> if the left-hand operand is sufficient to determine the outcome of the operation. Hence, the name &quot;short circuited&quot; (in that if possible, it will take an early shortcut out).</p><p>For example, with <code>a &amp;&amp; b</code>, <code>b</code> is not evaluated if <code>a</code> is falsy, because the result of the <code>&amp;&amp;</code> operand is already certain, so there&#39;s no point in bothering to check <code>b</code>. Likewise, with <code>a || b</code>, if <code>a</code> is truthy, the result of the operand is already certain, so there&#39;s no reason to check <code>b</code>.</p><p>This short circuiting can be very helpful and is commonly used:</p><div class="language-javascript ext-js line-numbers-mode"><pre class="language-javascript"><code><span class="token keyword">function</span> <span class="token function">doSomething</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token parameter">opts</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>

Another way this is commonly explained is that <code>&amp;&amp;</code> and <code>||</code> &quot;bind more tightly&quot; than <code>? :</code>. If the reverse was true, then <code>c ? c...</code> would bind more tightly, and it would behave (as the first choice) like <code>a &amp;&amp; b || (c ? c..)</code>.</p><h3 id="associativity" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#associativity" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Associativity</h3><p>So, the <code>&amp;&amp;</code> and <code>||</code> operators bind first, then the <code>? :</code> operator. But what about multiple operators of the same precedence? Do they always process left-to-right or right-to-left?</p><p>In general, operators are either left-associative or right-associative, referring to whether <strong>grouping happens from the left or from the right</strong>.</p><p>It&#39;s important to note that associativity is <em>not</em> the same thing as left-to-right or right-to-left processing.</p><p>But why does it matter whether processing is left-to-right or right-to-left? Because expressions can have side effects, like for instance with function calls:</p><div class="language-javascript ext-js line-numbers-mode"><pre class="language-javascript"><code><span class="token keyword">var</span> a <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token function">foo</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token operator">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="token function">bar</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
</code></pre><div class="line-numbers" aria-hidden="true"><span class="line-number">1</span><br></div></div><p>Here, <code>foo()</code> is evaluated first, and then possibly <code>bar()</code> depending on the result of the <code>foo()</code> expression. That definitely could result in different program behavior than if <code>bar()</code> was called before <code>foo()</code>.</p><p>But this behavior is <em>just</em> left-to-right processing (the default behavior in JavaScript!) -- it has nothing to do with the associativity of <code>&amp;&amp;</code>. In that example, since there&#39;s only one <code>&amp;&amp;</code> and thus no relevant grouping here, associativity doesn&#39;t even come into play.</p><p>But with an expression like <code>a &amp;&amp; b &amp;&amp; c</code>, grouping <em>will</em> happen implicitly, meaning that either <code>a &amp;&amp; b</code> or <code>b &amp;&amp; c</code> will be evaluated first.</p><p>Technically, <code>a &amp;&amp; b &amp;&amp; c</code> will be handled as <code>(a &amp;&amp; b) &amp;&amp; c</code>, because <code>&amp;&amp;</code> is left-associative (so is <code>||</code>, by the way). However, the right-associative alternative <code>a &amp;&amp; (b &amp;&amp; c)</code> behaves observably the same way. For the same values, the same expressions are evaluated in the same order.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> If hypothetically <code>&amp;&amp;</code> was right-associative, it would be processed the same as if you manually used <code>( )</code> to create grouping like <code>a &amp;&amp; (b &amp;&amp; c)</code>. But that still <strong>doesn&#39;t mean</strong> that <code>c</code> would be processed before <code>b</code>. Right-associativity does <strong>not</strong> mean right-to-left evaluation, it means right-to-left <strong>grouping</strong>. Either way, regardless of the grouping/associativity, the strict ordering of evaluation will be <code>a</code>, then <code>b</code>, then <code>c</code> (aka left-to-right).</p><p>So it doesn&#39;t really matter that much that <code>&amp;&amp;</code> and <code>||</code> are left-associative, other than to be accurate in how we discuss their definitions.</p><p>But that&#39;s not always the case. Some operators would behave very differently depending on left-associativity vs. right-associativity.</p><p>Consider the <code>? :</code> (&quot;ternary&quot; or &quot;conditional&quot;) operator:</p><div class="language-javascript ext-js line-numbers-mode"><pre class="language-javascript"><code>a <span class="token operator">?</span> b <span class="token operator">:</span> c <span class="token operator">?</span> d <span class="token operator">:</span> e<span class="token punctuation">;</span>

Should we only use <code>( )</code> manual grouping when it&#39;s necessary to force a different processing binding/order?</p><p>Or, on the other hand, should we recognize that even though such rules <em>are in fact</em> learnable, there&#39;s enough gotchas to warrant ignoring automatic precedence/associativity? If so, should we thus always use <code>( )</code> manual grouping and remove all reliance on these automatic behaviors?</p><p>This debate is highly subjective, and heavily symmetrical to the debate in Chapter 4 over <em>implicit</em> coercion. Most developers feel the same way about both debates: either they accept both behaviors and code expecting them, or they discard both behaviors and stick to manual/explicit idioms.</p><p>Of course, I cannot answer this question definitively for the reader here anymore than I could in Chapter 4. But I&#39;ve presented you the pros and cons, and hopefully encouraged enough deeper understanding that you can make informed rather than hype-driven decisions.</p><p>In my opinion, there&#39;s an important middle ground. We should mix both operator precedence/associativity <em>and</em> <code>( )</code> manual grouping into our programs -- I argue the same way in Chapter 4 for healthy/safe usage of <em>implicit</em> coercion, but certainly don&#39;t endorse it exclusively without bounds.</p><p>For example, <code>if (a &amp;&amp; b &amp;&amp; c) ..</code> is perfectly OK to me, and I wouldn&#39;t do <code>if ((a &amp;&amp; b) &amp;&amp; c) ..</code> just to explicitly call out the associativity, because I think it&#39;s overly verbose.</p><p>On the other hand, if I needed to chain two <code>? :</code> conditional operators together, I&#39;d certainly use <code>( )</code> manual grouping to make it absolutely clear what my intended logic is.</p><p>Thus, my advice here is similar to that of Chapter 4: <strong>use operator precedence/associativity where it leads to shorter and cleaner code, but use <code>( )</code> manual grouping in places where it helps create clarity and reduce confusion.</strong></p><h2 id="automatic-semicolons" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#automatic-semicolons" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Automatic Semicolons</h2><p>ASI (Automatic Semicolon Insertion) is when JavaScript assumes a <code>;</code> in certain places in your JS program even if you didn&#39;t put one there.</p><p>Why would it do that?

It is often asserted that ASI makes many <code>;</code>s optional, so a correctly written program <em>without them</em> is no different than a correctly written program <em>with them</em>.</p><p>On the con side of the debate, many other developers will assert that there are <em>too many</em> places that can be accidental gotchas, especially for newer, less experienced developers, where unintended <code>;</code>s being magically inserted change the meaning. Similarly, some developers will argue that if they omit a semicolon, it&#39;s a flat-out mistake, and they want their tools (linters, etc.) to catch it before the JS engine <em>corrects</em> the mistake under the covers.</p><p>Let me just share my perspective. A strict reading of the spec implies that ASI is an &quot;error correction&quot; routine. What kind of error, you may ask? Specifically, a <strong>parser error</strong>. In other words, in an attempt to have the parser fail less, ASI lets it be more tolerant.</p><p>But tolerant of what? In my view, the only way a <strong>parser error</strong> occurs is if it&#39;s given an incorrect/errored program to parse. So, while ASI is strictly correcting parser errors, the only way it can get such errors is if there were first program authoring errors -- omitting semicolons where the grammar rules require them.</p><p>So, to put it more bluntly, when I hear someone claim that they want to omit &quot;optional semicolons,&quot; my brain translates that claim to &quot;I want to write the most parser-broken program I can that will still work.&quot;</p><p>I find that to be a ludicrous position to take and the arguments of saving keystrokes and having more &quot;beautiful code&quot; to be weak at best.</p><p>Furthermore, I don&#39;t agree that this is the same thing as the spaces vs tabs debate -- that it&#39;s purely cosmetic -- but rather I believe it&#39;s a fundamental question of writing code that adheres to grammar requirements vs. code that relies on grammar exceptions to just barely skate through.</p><p>Another way of looking at it is that relying on ASI is essentially considering newlines to be significant &quot;whitespace.&quot; Other languages like Python have true significant whitespace. But is it really appropriate to think of JavaScript as having significant newlines as it stands today?</p><p>My take: <strong>use semicolons wherever you know they are &quot;required,&quot; and limit your assumptions about ASI to a minimum.</strong></p><p>But don&#39;t just take my word for it. Back in 2012, creator of JavaScript Brendan Eich said (http://brendaneich.com/2012/04/the-infernal-semicolon/) the following:</p><blockquote><p>The moral of this story: ASI is (formally speaking) a syntactic error correction procedure. If you start to code as if it were a universal significant-newline rule, you will get into trouble. .. I wish I had made newlines more significant in JS back in those ten days in May, 1995. .. Be careful not to use ASI as if it gave JS significant newlines.</p></blockquote><h2 id="errors" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#errors" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Errors</h2><p>Not only does JavaScript have different <em>subtypes</em> of errors (<code>TypeError</code>, <code>ReferenceError</code>, <code>SyntaxError</code>, etc.), but also the grammar defines certain errors to be enforced at compile time, as compared to all other errors that happen during runtime.</p><p>In particular, there have long been a number of specific conditions that should be caught and reported as &quot;early errors&quot; (during compilation). Any straight-up syntax error is an early error (e.g., <code>a = ,</code>), but also the grammar defines things that are syntactically valid but disallowed nonetheless.</p><p>Since execution of your code has not begun yet, these errors are not catchable with <code>try..catch</code>; they will just fail the parsing/compilation of your program.</p><p><strong>Tip:</strong> There&#39;s no requirement in the spec about exactly how browsers (and developer tools) should report errors. So you may see variations across browsers in the following error examples, in what specific subtype of error is reported or what the included error message text will be.</p><p>One simple example is with syntax inside a regular expression literal. There&#39;s nothing wrong with the JS syntax here, but the invalid regex will throw an early error:</p><div class="language-javascript ext-js line-numbers-mode"><pre class="language-javascript"><code><span class="token keyword">var</span> a <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token regex"><span class="token regex-delimiter">/</span><span class="token regex-source language-regex">+foo</span><span class="token regex-delimiter">/</span></span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>		<span class="token comment">// Error!</span>

A little bit of effort goes a long way to solidifying your deeper knowledge of the language.</p><p>Statements and expressions have analogs in English language -- statements are like sentences and expressions are like phrases. Expressions can be pure/self-contained, or they can have side effects.</p><p>The JavaScript grammar layers semantic usage rules (aka context) on top of the pure syntax. For example, <code>{ }</code> pairs used in various places in your program can mean statement blocks, <code>object</code> literals, (ES6) destructuring assignments, or (ES6) named function arguments.</p><p>JavaScript operators all have well-defined rules for precedence (which ones bind first before others) and associativity (how multiple operator expressions are implicitly grouped). Once you learn these rules, it&#39;s up to you to decide if precedence/associativity are <em>too implicit</em> for their own good, or if they will aid in writing shorter, clearer code.</p><p>ASI (Automatic Semicolon Insertion) is a parser-error-correction mechanism built into the JS engine, which allows it under certain circumstances to insert an assumed <code>;</code> in places where it is required, was omitted, <em>and</em> where insertion fixes the parser error. The debate rages over whether this behavior implies that most <code>;</code> are optional (and can/should be omitted for cleaner code) or whether it means that omitting them is making mistakes that the JS engine merely cleans up for you.</p><p>JavaScript has several types of errors, but it&#39;s less known that it has two classifications for errors: &quot;early&quot; (compiler thrown, uncatchable) and &quot;runtime&quot; (<code>try..catch</code>able). All syntax errors are obviously early errors that stop the program before it runs, but there are others, too.</p><p>Function arguments have an interesting relationship to their formal declared named parameters. Specifically, the <code>arguments</code> array has a number of gotchas of leaky abstraction behavior if you&#39;re not careful. Avoid <code>arguments</code> if you can, but if you must use it, by all means avoid using the positional slot in <code>arguments</code> at the same time as using a named parameter for that same argument.</p><p>The <code>finally</code> clause attached to a <code>try</code> (or <code>try..catch</code>) offers some very interesting quirks in terms of execution processing order. Some of these quirks can be helpful, but it&#39;s possible to create lots of confusion, especially if combined with labeled blocks. As always, use <code>finally</code> to make code better and clearer, not more clever or confusing.</p><p>The <code>switch</code> offers some nice shorthand for <code>if..else if..</code> statements, but beware of many common simplifying assumptions about its behavior. There are several quirks that can trip you up if you&#39;re not careful, but there&#39;s also some neat hidden tricks that <code>switch</code> has up its sleeve!</p>`,373);function t(o,p){return e}var r=n(a,[["render",t],["__file","ch5.html.vue"]]);export{r as default};
