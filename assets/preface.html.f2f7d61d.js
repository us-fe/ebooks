While flickering mouse trails and annoying pop-up prompts may be where JavaScript started, nearly 2 decades later, the technology and capability of JavaScript has grown many orders of magnitude, and few doubt its importance at the heart of the world&#39;s most widely available software platform: the web.</p><p>But as a language, it has perpetually been a target for a great deal of criticism, owing partly to its heritage but even more to its design philosophy. Even the name evokes, as Brendan Eich once put it, &quot;dumb kid brother&quot; status next to its more mature older brother &quot;Java&quot;. But the name is merely an accident of politics and marketing. The two languages are vastly different in many important ways. &quot;JavaScript&quot; is as related to &quot;Java&quot; as &quot;Carnival&quot; is to &quot;Car&quot;.</p><p>Because JavaScript borrows concepts and syntax idioms from several languages, including proud C-style procedural roots as well as subtle, less obvious Scheme/Lisp-style functional roots, it is exceedingly approachable to a broad audience of developers, even those with just little to no programming experience. The &quot;Hello World&quot; of JavaScript is so simple that the language is inviting and easy to get comfortable with in early exposure.</p><p>While JavaScript is perhaps one of the easiest languages to get up and running with, its eccentricities make solid mastery of the language a vastly less common occurrence than in many other languages. Where it takes a pretty in-depth knowledge of a language like C or C++ to write a full-scale program, full-scale production JavaScript can, and often does, barely scratch the surface of what the language can do.</p><p>Sophisticated concepts which are deeply rooted into the language tend instead to surface themselves in <em>seemingly</em> simplistic ways, such as passing around functions as callbacks, which encourages the JavaScript developer to just use the language as-is and not worry too much about what&#39;s going on under the hood.</p><p>It is simultaneously a simple, easy-to-use language that has broad appeal, and a complex and nuanced collection of language mechanics which without careful study will elude <em>true understanding</em> even for the most seasoned of JavaScript developers.</p><p>Therein lies the paradox of JavaScript, the Achilles&#39; Heel of the language, the challenge we are presently addressing. Because JavaScript <em>can</em> be used without understanding, the understanding of the language is often never attained.</p><h2 id="mission" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#mission" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Mission</h2><p>If at every point that you encounter a surprise or frustration in JavaScript, your response is to add it to the blacklist, as some are accustomed to doing, you soon will be relegated to a hollow shell of the richness of JavaScript.</p><p>While this subset has been famously dubbed &quot;The Good Parts&quot;, I would implore you, dear reader, to instead consider it the &quot;The Easy Parts&quot;, &quot;The Safe Parts&quot;, or even &quot;The Incomplete Parts&quot;.</p><p>This <em>You Don&#39;t Know JavaScript</em> book series offers a contrary challenge: learn and deeply understand <em>all</em> of JavaScript, even and especially &quot;The Tough Parts&quot;.</p><p>Here, we address head on the tendency of JS developers to learn &quot;just enough&quot; to get by, without ever forcing themselves to learn exactly how and why the language behaves the way it does. Furthermore, we eschew the common advice to <em>retreat</em> when the road gets rough.</p><p>I am not content, nor should you be, at stopping once something <em>just works</em>, and not really knowing <em>why</em>. I gently challenge you to journey down that bumpy &quot;road less traveled&quot; and embrace all that JavaScript is and can do. With that knowledge, no technique, no framework, no popular buzzword acronym of the week, will be beyond your understanding.</p><p>These books each take on specific core parts of the language which are most commonly misunderstood or under-understood, and dive very deep and exhaustively into them. You should come away from reading with a firm confidence in your understanding, not just of the theoretical, but the practical &quot;what you need to know&quot; bits.</p><p>The JavaScript you know <em>right now</em> is probably <em>parts</em> handed down to you by others who&#39;ve been burned by incomplete understanding. <em>That</em> JavaScript is but a shadow of the true language. You don&#39;t <em>really</em> know JavaScript, <em>yet</em>, but if you dig into this series, you <em>will</em>. Read on, my friends. JavaScript awaits you.</p><h2 id="summary" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#summary" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Summary</h2><p>JavaScript is awesome. It&#39;s easy to learn partially, and much harder to learn completely (or even <em>sufficiently</em>). When developers encounter confusion, they usually blame the language instead of their lack of understanding. These books aim to fix that, inspiring a strong appreciation for the language you can now, and <em>should</em>, deeply <em>know</em>.</p><p>Note: Many of the examples in this book assume modern (and future-reaching) JavaScript engine environments, such as ES6. Some code may not work as described if run in older (pre-ES6) engines.</p>',21);function n(r,s){return o}var u=e(t,[["render",n],["__file","preface.html.vue"]]);export{u as default};
